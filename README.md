# CS4824-final-project

## Methods
We use Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and NN to predict the news category.  

## Dataset
Our dataset is from MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND) (https://msnews.github.io/).  
We extract the news title, abstract and category from MIND.  
Totally, we have 16 categories in our news dataset.  
We have 81,222 news in the training set(train.csv) and 20,305 news in the testing set(test.csv).  
 * For example:  
News(MLB's most problematic contracts: Miguel Cabrera's massive deal leads AL Central issues) => Category(sports)  

## 16 Categories  
autos, entertainment, finance, foodanddrink, health, kids, lifestyle, movies, music, news, northamerica, sports, travel, tv, video, weather.
